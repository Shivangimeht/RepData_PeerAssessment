###1. Total number of steps taken per day.

totalstepsperday <- aggregate(steps ~ date,data = activity, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
head(totalstepsperday)

###2.Make a histogram of total number of steps taken each day

hist(totalstepsperday$steps, main="Total number of steps in a day",xlab="Number of per steps per day", ylab = "Interval", col = "orange",breaks=50)

###3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.

MeanData <- mean(totalstepsperday$steps)

medianData <- mean(totalstepsperday$steps)

summary(totalstepsperday$steps)

###4.What is the average daily activity pattern?

###A.Make a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") 
of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, 
averaged across all days (y-axis)

###Five minutes average using steps to interval - Fun = mean instead of Sum

fivemin <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

###plot

plot(x = fivemin$interval, y = fivemin$steps, type = "l", col = "red", xlab="5-minute interval", ylab = "average number of steps taken",main="Average Daily Activity Pattern")

###B.Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

maximumSteps <- fivemin$interval[which.max(fivemin$steps)]

####Imputing Missing Values####

###1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
(i.e. the total number of rows with \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NAs)

activity2 <- activity
nA <- is.na(activity2$steps)
avg_interval <- tapply(activity2$steps, activity2$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify = TRUE)
activity2$steps[nA] <- avg_interval[as.character(activity2$interval[nA])]
names(activity2)
sum(is.na(activity2))

####2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and 
Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?
What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

par(mfrow=c(1,2))

totalstepsperday2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity2, FUN = sum, na.rm=TRUE)
head(totalstepsperday2)

hist(totalstepsperday2$steps, main = "Total Steps per Day(no-na)", xlab="Number of steps per Day", ylab="Interval",col="green",breaks=50)

hist(totalstepsperday$steps, main =  "Total steps per Day(Original)", xlab="Number of steps per Day", ylab="Interval",col="Orange",breaks=50)

####Impact of Imputing missing values

par(mfrow=c(1,1))

summary(totalstepsperday)
summary(totalstepsperday2)

head(activity2)

###Difference between Weekdays and Weekend####

##1.Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – 
“weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or
weekend day.

head(activity2)

activity2$RealDate <- as.Date(activity2$date)
activity2$weekday <- weekdays(activity2$RealDate)
activity2$typeofday <- ifelse(activity2$weekday=='Saturday'|
                                 activity2$weekday=='Sunday','weekend','weekday')


head(activity2)

###2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

fivemin2<- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
head(fivemin2)

ggplot(activity2, aes(x =interval , y=steps, color=typeofday)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Ave Daily Steps (type of day)", x = "Interval", y = "Total Number of Steps") +
  facet_wrap(~ typeofday, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
